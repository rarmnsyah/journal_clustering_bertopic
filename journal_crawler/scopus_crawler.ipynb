CLO equity tranches earn positive abnormal returns from the risk‐adjusted price differential between leveraged loans and CLO debt tranches. Debt tranches offer higher returns than similarly rated corporate bonds, making them attractive to banks and insurers that face risk‐based capital requirements. Temporal variation in equity performance highlights the resilience of CLOs to market volatility due to their closed‐end structure, long‐term funding, and embedded options to reinvest principal\\xa0proceeds.</jats:p>',\n",

We find that borrowers seek credit from banks that specialize in their export destinations, both when expanding exports and when exporting to new countries. Firms experiencing country‐specific export demand shocks adjust borrowing disproportionately from specialized banks. Specialized bank credit supply shocks affect exports disproportionately to countries of specialization. Our results demonstrate that firm credit demand is bank‐ and activity‐specific, which reduces banking competition and affects the transmission and amplification of shocks through the banking\\xa0sector.</jats:p>',\n",

       "  'abstract': '<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title><jats:p>We analyze how regulatory constraints on household leverage—in the form of loan‐to‐income and loan‐to‐value limits—affect residential mortgage credit and house prices as well as other asset classes not directly targeted by the limits. Loan‐level data suggest that mortgage credit is reallocated from low‐ to high‐income borrowers and from urban to rural counties. This reallocation weakens the feedback between credit and house prices and slows house price growth in “hot” housing markets. Banks whose lending to households is more affected by the regulatory constraint drive this reallocation, but also substitute their risk‐taking into holdings of securities and corporate\\xa0credit.</jats:p>',\n",

These patterns differ significantly from commonly analyzed trend signals, yield more accurate return predictions, enable more profitable investment strategies, and demonstrate robustness across specifications.

Recent advances in\\n molecular phylogenies, revealed that <jats:italic>Acremonium</jats:italic> is highly polyphyletic and members of<jats:italic> Acremonium s. lat.</jats:italic> belong to at least three distinct orders of<jats:italic> Sordariomycetes</jats:italic>, of which numerous orders, families and genera with acremonium-like morphs remain undefined. To infer the\\n phylogenetic relationships and establish a natural classification for acremonium-like taxa, systematic analyses were conducted based on a large number of cultures with a global distribution and varied substrates. A total of 633 cultures with acremonium-like morphology, including 261 ex-type\\n cultures from 89 countries and a variety of substrates including soil, plants, fungi, humans, insects, air, and water were examined. An overview phylogenetic tree based on three loci (ITS, LSU,<jats:italic> rpb2</jats:italic>) was generated to delimit the orders and families. Separate trees based on a combined\\n analysis of four loci (ITS, LSU,<jats:italic> rpb2</jats:italic>,<jats:italic> tef-1α</jats:italic>) were used to delimit species at generic and family levels.

       "   '<jats:p><jats:italic>Clonostachys</jats:italic>(<jats:italic>Bionectriaceae</jats:italic>,<jats:italic>Hypocreales</jats:italic>species are common soil-borne fungi, endophytes, epiphytes, and saprotrophs. Sexual morphs of<jats:italic>Clonostachys</jats:italic>spp<jats:italic>.</jats:italic>were placed in the genus<jats:italic>Bionectria</jats:italic>,<jats:italic />which was further segregated into the six subgenera<jats:italic>Astromata</jats:italic>,<jats:italic>Bionectria</jats:italic>,<jats:italic>Epiphloea</jats:italic>,<jats:italic>Myronectria</jats:italic>,<jats:italic>Uniparietina</jats:italic>, and<jats:italic>Zebrinella</jats:italic>. However, with the end of dual nomenclature,<jats:italic>Clonostachys</jats:italic>became the single depository for sexual and asexual morph-typified species. Species of<jats:italic>Clonostachys</jats:italic>are typically characterised by penicillate, sporodochial, and, in many cases, dimorphic conidiophores (primary and secondary conidiophores). Primary conidiophores are mononematous, either verticillium-like or narrowly penicillate. The secondary conidiophores generally form imbricate conidial chains that can collapse to slimy masses, particularly on sporodochia. In the present study, we investigated the species diversity within a collection of 420 strains of<jats:italic>Clonostachys</jats:italic>from the culture collection of, and personal collections at, the Westerdijk Fungal Biodiversity Institute in Utrecht, the Netherlands. Strains were analysed based on their morphological characters and molecular phylogeny. The latter used DNA sequence data of the nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer regions and intervening 5.8S nrDNA (ITS) and partial 28S large subunit (LSU) nrDNA and partial protein encoding genes including the RNA polymerase II second largest subunit (<jats:italic>RPB2</jats:italic>), translation elongation factor 1-alpha (<jats:italic>TEF1</jats:italic>) and β-tubulin (<jats:italic>TUB2</jats:italic>). Based on these results, the subgenera<jats:italic>Astromata</jats:italic>,<jats:italic>Bionectria</jats:italic>,<jats:italic>Myronectria</jats:italic>and<jats:italic>Zebrinella</jats:italic>are supported within<jats:italic>Clonostachys</jats:italic>. Furthermore, the genus<jats:italic>Sesquicillium</jats:italic>is resurrected to accommodate the former subgenera<jats:italic>Epiphloea</jats:italic>and<jats:italic>Uniparietina</jats:italic>. The close relationship of<jats:italic>Clonostachys</jats:italic>and<jats:italic>Sesquicillium</jats:italic>is strongly supported as both are inferred phylogenetically as sister-genera. New taxa include 24 new species and 10 new combinations. Recognition of<jats:italic>Sesquicillium</jats:italic>distinguishes species typically forming a reduced perithecial stroma superficially on plant tissue from species in<jats:italic>Clonostachys</jats:italic>often forming well-developed, through bark erumpent stromata. The patterns of observed perithecial wall anatomies, perithecial wall and stroma interfaces, and asexual morph diversifications described in a previously compiled monograph are used for interpreting ancestral state reconstructions. It is inferred that the common ancestor of<jats:italic>Clonostachys</jats:italic>and<jats:italic>Sesquicillium</jats:italic>may have formed perithecia superficially on leaves, possessed a perithecial wall consisting of a single region, and formed intercalary phialides in penicilli of conidiophores. Character interpretation may also allow hypothesising that diversification of morphs occurred then in the two genera independently and that the frequently stroma-linked<jats:italic>Clonostachys</jats:italic>morphs evolved together with the occupation of woody host niches and mycoparasitism.</jats:p>',\n",

There are currently 14 accepted genera in the Order. They include species that are the causal agents of plant and human diseases and common associates\\n of insects such as bark beetles. Well known examples include the Dutch elm disease fungi and the causal agents of sporotrichosis in humans and animals. The taxonomy of the <jats:italic>Ophiostomatales</jats:italic> was confused for many years, mainly due to the convergent evolution of morphological characters\\n used to delimit unrelated fungal taxa. The emergence of DNA-based methods has resolved much of this confusion. However, the delineation of some genera and the placement of various species and smaller lineages remains inconclusive. In this study we reconsidered the generic boundaries within\\n the<jats:italic> Ophiostomatales</jats:italic>. A phylogenomic framework constructed from genome-wide sequence data for 31 species representing the major genera in the Order was used as a guide to delineate genera. This framework also informed our choice of the best markers from the currently most commonly used\\n gene regions for taxonomic studies of these fungi. DNA was amplified and sequenced for more than 200 species, representing all lineages in the Order. We constructed phylogenetic trees based on the different gene regions and assembled a concatenated data set utilising a suite of phylogenetic\\n analyses. The results supported and confirmed the delineation of nine of the 14 currently accepted genera,<jats:italic> i.e.Aureovirgo, Ceratocystiopsis, Esteya, Fragosphaeria, Graphilbum, Hawksworthiomyces, Ophiostoma, Raffaelea </jats:italic> and <jats:italic> Sporothrix</jats:italic>.

Two lineages included the type species of<jats:italic>Grosmannia</jats:italic> and<jats:italic>Dryadomyces </jats:italic>and these genera<jats:italic> </jats:italic> are\\n thus reinstated and their circumscriptions redefined.

Unlike vegetative hyphae, fruiting bodies grow determinately and follow a genetically encoded developmental program that\\n orchestrates their growth, tissue differentiation and sexual sporulation. In spite of more than a century of research, our understanding of the molecular details of fruiting body morphogenesis is still limited and a general synthesis on the genetics of this complex process is lacking. In this\\n paper, we aim at a comprehensive identification of conserved genes related to fruiting body morphogenesis and distil novel functional hypotheses for functionally poorly characterised ones. As a result of this analysis, we report 921 conserved developmentally expressed gene families, only a\\n few dozens of which have previously been reported to be involved in fruiting body development. Based on literature data, conserved expression patterns and functional annotations, we provide hypotheses on the potential role of these gene families in fruiting body development, yielding the most\\n complete description of molecular processes in fruiting body morphogenesis to date. We discuss genes related to the initiation of fruiting, differentiation, growth, cell surface and cell wall, defence, transcriptional regulation as well as signal transduction. Based on these data we derive\\n a general model of fruiting body development, which includes an early, proliferative phase that is mostly concerned with laying out the mushroom body plan (via cell division and differentiation), and a second phase of growth via cell expansion as well as meiotic events and sporulation.

Genera were delimited following the criteria that a genus must be a statistically\\n well-supported monophyletic clade in both the multigene phylogeny and molecular dating analysis, fall within a divergence time of over 27 million years ago, and be supported by ecological preference or phenotypic traits. Based on the results of the phylogeny and molecular dating analyses,\\n combined with morphological characters and temperature-growth characteristics, 50 genera and 275 species are accepted in <jats:italic>Chaetomiaceae</jats:italic>. Among them, six new genera, six new species, 45 new combinations and three new names are proposed.

Similar to the 17 narrowly defined species, the four broadly defined species do not have a specific ecology and\\n are distributed worldwide.

In this study, we propose a new theory, that in corporate lobbying within the nonmarket strategy context, the liability of foreignness is driven in no small part by a values-based ideological conflict stemming from the divide between democracy and autocracy. Private-sector firms from autocratic countries face costs of illegitimacy in Washington, D.C., and professional corporate lobbyists charge such firms a fee premium, in effect, to pay for legitimacy. We conduct an empirical study of the lobbying fees charged by professional corporate lobbyists in Washington, D.C., to their domestic and foreign firm clients, and the results strongly support the predictions of our theory. We also show that the liability of foreignness in this context endures for foreign firms from autocratic countries over the 15-year length of our sample period. Offering a new theoretical perspective as well as new empirical findings regarding the liability of foreignness, our study has practical implications for managers of foreign firms and may also generalize to other market contexts. </jats:p>',\n",
       "   '<jats:p> Interorganizational partnerships can spur innovation, but their value may be diminished by friction in knowledge flows between firms. We consider how a partner’s organizational structure may influence the knowledge that is accessible via partnerships. We focus on how a partner’s structure trades off localized autonomy for its managers, which facilitates timelier decision making, and unified control, which facilitates integration. By shaping this balance, centralization of decision rights within the partner organization shapes access to its knowledge. Centralized structures generate wide-ranging internal knowledge pathways that enable access to a broader array of a partner’s knowledge. However, the reduced managerial autonomy afforded by centralization makes decision making more cumbersome, which constricts the rate of access to a partner’s knowledge. We find evidence of this tradeoff in the context of corporate venture capital relationships between incumbents and startups in the pharmaceutical industry. An increase in the incumbent’s diversity of knowledge or in the knowledge required by the startup enhances the value of a greater breadth of access, whereas the degree to which the startup can leverage social ties (affinity) or hierarchical fiat (authority) alleviates the costs of a reduced access rate. Each of these features makes an incumbent organization’s centralization more valuable to the startup. By highlighting this tension related to centralization, our findings suggest that new firms striving to maximize their partnership benefits may need to carefully consider their partners’ internal structures. </jats:p>',\n",

Scholars and policymakers alike have argued that disclosure will lead to greater social accountability—either reputational harm for firms revealing large disparities or benefit for more-egalitarian organizations. Yet little research has directly tested this central assumption. We advance understanding of this issue by examining reactions from a key constituency affected by pay gaps: employees. We analyze the existence, magnitude, and persistence of changes in employees’ public affective evaluations of their employers on the review site Glassdoor in the wake of pay gap disclosures prompted by new regulations in the United Kingdom. We find a short-lived improvement in employees’ evaluations of organizations reporting pay parity, consistent with a reputational boost. At the same time, we find little evidence of a negative post-disclosure reaction from employees of firms reporting sizable gender-based disparities. We take an abductive approach to investigate these surprising findings, probing key assumptions and the viability of different plausible explanations for the results.

I discovered that founders’ use of the coworking space occasioned distinct interaction patterns. Over time, varying interactions played a central role in whether the workspace became a community or remained a mere office space to these founders. Such emergent spatial meanings were coupled with whether founders themselves developed as entrepreneurs or not within their workspace. Founders’ perceptions of the workspace as a community were generally associated with their identifying more as entrepreneurs, while their perceptions of the workspace as an office were usually linked with their identifying less, and even disidentifying, as entrepreneurs. In explaining these dynamics, I contribute to research on identity and space, research on entrepreneurial identity, and broader scholarship on space and interactions in organizations. For first-time founders, the meanings associated with being an entrepreneur can be equivocal, and where they work helps to shape their answers to the questions “What is entrepreneurship to me?” and “Who am I?” </jats:p>',\n",

Since the 1990s, nine states have banned affirmative action practice in public universities and state governments. I theorize that although these bans have no legal jurisdiction over private-sector firms, they could influence such firms normatively. After such a ban, executives who have been skeptical of Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) policies may feel more normative license to reduce commitment to EEO practices. Using a difference-in-differences estimation on 11,311 firms from 1985 to 2015, I find that the bans are indeed associated with slower racial progress in private-sector firms: after a state adopts the affirmative action ban, growth in the proportion of Black managers in establishments with corporate headquarters in that state slows by more than 50 percent, and this slowdown is mostly concentrated in firms with politically conservative CEOs. These findings suggest a mechanism for the persistence of racial inequality and show that regulations can influence actors well beyond legal jurisdictions. </jats:p>',\n",

Yet, in some professional contexts, these aims are in tension because serving elite clients is considered the pinnacle of professional success, but professionals themselves may view serving this clientele as antithetical to making a societal contribution. Drawing on interviews with 84 architects and designers who self-identify as people seeking to contribute to society—that is, who hold a prosocial identity—we develop theory about how professionals navigate tensions between their prosocial and professional identities and with what consequences for their work with clients. We identified four strategies that professionals used to ease these tensions, all of which gave the prosocially oriented professionals a sense of identity integration. However, these strategies differently shaped professionals’ approach to power relations with the client, depending on the client’s status and the types of knowledge and skills each professional viewed as central to their work. Professionals with marginalized social identities, such as women and ethnic/racial minorities, were more likely than others to embrace working with low-status clients and to use broader definitions of the knowledge and skills required for their work.

We argue that for business leaders, the scale of protests serves as an information update regarding the changing relevance of the protested social issue in a community. Using data from 2017 to 2020 on Women’s March protests in the United States, we show that the scale of street protests in local communities is associated with the likelihood of subsequent female director appointments for corporations headquartered in those communities: larger-scale protests are associated with a higher likelihood of such appointments. Further, we show that this response to proximal protests is heightened for protests that occur in local communities least aligned with the protest movement and for companies least internally aligned with the protest goals. Our theory and findings extend research on social movements in markets, showing how and why organizations respond to diffuse community protests, and they enrich corporate governance research on the roles of communities and stakeholders in shaping board composition. </jats:p>',\n",

Yet most research on social networks adopts either a structural or a perceptual perspective. In this article, I blend these two traditions to examine how actual and perceptual brokerage jointly determine innovation performance. I hypothesize that while actual brokerage benefits individuals by exposing them to nonredundant information, socially perceived brokerage—being perceived to bridge groups regardless of one’s actual network configuration—may trigger skepticism of brokers’ motives that could hinder their ability to innovate. Thus I argue that others’ perceptions of a focal actor’s brokerage opportunities constitute a critical contingency underlying network advantage. Using a multimethod approach, including a field study in a global consulting firm and a preregistered experiment, I find that individuals spanning structural holes achieve higher innovation performance when their colleagues perceive them to have closed rather than open networks, and that trust is the underlying mechanism driving this effect. Integrating insights from cognitive social structures into structural holes theory, this study illustrates the importance of considering both structural and perceptual mechanisms in modeling how individuals reap the benefits of brokerage.</jats:p>',\n",

Prior research on nonmarket strategy has largely focused on established firms in mature industries, but such strategies are apt to differ for new ventures, which generally have limited resources and market power and operate in novel domains in which the rules of the game are underdeveloped. How do new ventures navigate regulatory uncertainty? To explore this question, we conduct an inductive, multi-case research study of five ventures that pioneered the nascent personal-genomics industry. Drawing on extensive qualitative data, we develop an emergent theoretical framework that elucidates how ventures navigate evolving regulatory uncertainty. Grounded in a power versus industry-evolution logic, this framework illuminates how ventures’ strategies for doing so vary and theorizes why certain strategies appear more effective than others. In doing so, we also introduce a novel logic of interaction— regulatory co-creation—that ventures can employ to shape emerging regulations. Taken together, our theory and findings challenge existing perspectives on strategy in nascent industries, shed light on the dynamic interplay between market and nonmarket strategy, and recast the relationship between ventures and regulators during the emergence of new technology industries. </jats:p>',\n",

These modular scaffolding practices offered temporary stabilization and support that fostered the counter-normative behaviors and mindsets required for continuous learning and adaptive coordination. Through 226 in-depth interviews with international development experts, including practitioners in eight matched interventions in India, Mexico, South Africa, and Ghana, we identified and analyzed mechanisms that explain the varying effectiveness with which evidence was integrated in each case.

This type of activism follows a different logic from that of more-familiar citizen activism, in which citizens directly target society and its institutions, and that of organizational-change activism, in which employees aim to influence their employer organization. This article develops and tests theory to understand this phenomenon of organization-as-platform activism, using the National Football League “Take a Knee” employee athlete protests as an empirical context. Drawing on past research on social movements and employee activism, we offer a theoretical comparison of these three forms of activism—citizen, organizational-change, and organization-as-platform—to conceptually distinguish them and to theorize factors that uniquely predict the occurrence of platform activism. We find evidence of predictors associated with the attributes of the organizational platform and those of the intended stakeholder audience. Organization-as-platform activism is associated with the accessibility and openness of the organizational platform for messaging use, the visibility of the organizational platform for message transmission, and the receptivity of the targeted stakeholder audience. As employees increasingly bring their non-work identities and beliefs into the workplace, our findings invite new research on the outcomes of platform activism for organizations, the implications of such activism for organizational stakeholder strategy, and the relation between platform activism and employee prosocial voice. </jats:p>',\n",

We first tested our theory in a field study using longitudinal data from 102 innovation teams at a Fortune Global 500 company; then, we replicated and elaborated our theory in a study of 61 MBA project teams at an elite North American university. Results show that some learning activities can occur within the same teamwork episode to have harmonious positive effects on team performance, while other activities combine to have dissonant negative effects when occurring in the same episode. We argue that dissonant activities must be spread across teamwork episodes to help teams achieve a positive rhythm of team learning over time.

Research has shown that in response to market alternatives, incumbents resist through heterogeneous behaviors: incumbents maintain their commitment to the dominant logic, effectively marginalizing challengers, while also ostensibly endorsing the alternative logic and often successfully coopting challengers. Although incumbents’ strategic responses to pioneering market alternatives are well documented, we do not know how their heterogeneous behaviors affect new waves of challenger mobilization and how these mobilizations may differently address the hazards of cooptation and marginalization. We investigate the rise of the B Corp (Certified B Corporation) movement against the backdrop of both ongoing shareholder supremacy and rising corporate social responsibility (CSR) among incumbent corporations. Our multi-method, multi-stage investigation reveals that heterogeneous incumbent behaviors encourage new waves of challenger mobilization by seeding divergent mobilizing frames. This variety can lead to a paradoxical form of mobilization in which challengers dynamically balance the tension between their movements’ focus on expansion and purity, rather than prioritizing one over the other. The B Corp movement demonstrates how achieving this balance may help challengers avoid cooptation or marginalization, sustain their challenge against incumbents, and achieve more-transformative change. For incumbents, our findings show that both resistance to and the ostensible embrace of alternative logics may stave off immediate challenges but can also invigorate future challenges that pose substantive threats to the dominant logic. </jats:p>',\n",

We call the extent to which such interactions diverge from audience expectations performative atypicality. Applying a novel deep-learning method to conversational text in over 90,000 earnings calls, we find that performative atypicality leads to an evaluation premium by securities analysts, paradoxically resulting in a negative earnings surprise.

Existing theories posit that organizations achieve normative control through encapsulation, wherein peers and managers are primary sources of members’ socialization. Drawing on ethnographic data from a not-for-profit school, I show how an external actor—beneficiaries—can become a source of normative control. I develop a multistage process that explains how teachers were socialized by parents, specifically by hearing these parent beneficiaries narrate their needs; engaging in collective storytelling about beneficiaries; experiencing episodic shaming centered on how teachers’ daily performance met (or did not meet) beneficiaries’ needs; and receiving validation from beneficiaries. Because these sequential stages establish beneficiaries as sources of control through social interactions set in specific times and places, and establish shared emotional states among organizational members, I theorize that these stages compose a ritual of integration. Although teachers initially arrived at the school with heterogeneous values, this ritual led many of them to internalize the organizational value of self-sacrifice. Teachers who were unmoved by parents’ stories or came to see parents as exploitative did not internalize this value, and they tended to exit the organization. This study reveals how normative control can arise not only through socialization from in-group members but also from ritual interactions with and about beneficiaries. </jats:p>',\n",

Yet, a resource-overlap perspective may not always align with decision-makers’ similarity classifications. In this article, we propose that new entrants also perceive firm similarities in terms of collective identities, and we examine how competition between collective identities influences entrants’ choice of location. Our arguments center on the distinction between unaffiliated traditionalists, actors who are loyal to values and practices originally associated with a label and who emphasize autonomy, and affiliated modernists, actors who reinterpret a label using different values and practices and who seek consistency. Analyzing the entry of 177 artisan bakers within the city of Lyon from 1998 to 2017, we find that new entrants locate where prior actors with similar collective identities had located previously. To differentiate through competition, however, some new entrants also tend to prefer locations closer to actors who are encroaching on their collective identity, most evident among traditionalists choosing to locate near modernists. By integrating a collective-identity perspective with location choice, we show how the sociocognitive basis of similarity classification shapes new entrants’ competitive behavior. </jats:p>',\n",

In fact, no prior research has examined how users’ occupational considerations may shape technology trajectories, despite a large literature on how occupations condition interactions with technological tools. This article sheds light on these processes through an inductive study of the music synthesizer industry’s shifts from analog to digital and back to analog technology. Leveraging more than 40 years of data, we trace the relationship between technological developments and synthesizer players’ occupational meaning. While synthesists initially embraced the ease of use and novelty of digital’s black-boxed preset sounds, widespread adoption of digital sounds ultimately undermined musicians’ occupational goal of distinctive creative expression. In response, synthesists articulated preferences for technology that afforded control, enabling them to use their expertise to create sounds, and that provided an embodied connection with the tool. Synthesists associated these affordances with analog rather than digital instruments, leading to renewed demand for analog and the reemergence of a formerly displaced technology. Our work integrates occupational considerations into the literature on technology trajectories, uncovers new mechanisms that can underlie technology reemergence, and extends the literature on occupations and technology.</jats:p>',\n",

We investigate this question through a rich set of oral histories and archival materials on the emergence of the category AIDS from 1978 to 1985. We show that the initial proto-category’s features and causal theories cohered with its stigmatized moral meanings. Over time, anomalies challenging these features and theories spurred a minority of medical professionals to update the category’s causal theory. However, a silent majority resisted updating the category because the new causal theory conflicted with the proto-category’s moral meanings, challenging the clear moral boundary dividing what was perceived as worthy from what was perceived as unworthy. As a result, the majority silenced the vocal minority’s updated understandings and withheld resources from the category. This article contributes to the literature on categorization by showing that conflicts between category dimensions can stifle updating, amplify imprinting, and prolong category persistence. Particularly, the dichotomous nature of the moral dimension might hinder the updating of other dimensions, such as the causal one, despite accumulated evidence suggesting the need for updates.

Employers can focus either on applicants’ potential and select on foundational skills (e.g., social skills, math skills) or on their readiness and select on more-advanced skills (e.g., pricing a derivative). The higher (lower) the social trust—people’s trust in their fellow members of society—the more (less) employers are willing to invest in employees and grant them role flexibility. Employers in higher-trust societies are therefore more attentive to applicants’ potential, focusing more on foundational skills than on advanced skills. We empirically test this theory by using a novel dataset of more than 50 million job postings from the 28 European Union countries. We find that the higher a country’s social trust, the more its employers require foundational skills instead of advanced skills. Our identification strategy takes advantage of multinational firms in our sample and uses measures of bilateral (country-to-country) trust to predict job requirements, while including an instrumental variable and fixed effects on country, year, employer, and occupation.

The results show that training improves favela dwellers’ economic outcomes, such as by increasing income and participation in entrepreneurship, and some socio-psychological outcomes, such as by improving self-efficacy and optimism. However, these income improvements were accompanied by participants’ enhanced experiences of favela stigma, an adverse socio-psychological outcome related to their residential segregation.

After acquiring its second robot, the hospital divided resources between the older and newer robots to build its surgical capacity: it allocated the best available infrastructure to the new robot, and it prioritized assigning inexperienced talent to the new technology to facilitate use and skill development. The hospital then adjusted its resources to build on initial successes, committing both the best available maintenance and more-complex surgical cases to the newer robot. These dynamics inadvertently degraded the older robot, making it increasingly difficult to use. In response, more-experienced surgeons and staff made do with the degrading system: they developed and mastered workarounds, and they developed a venting cycle with management. Their actions reduced concerns about the older technology and stabilized the situation for the hospital, such that for years this portfolio resourcing process facilitated satisfactory outcomes on organizational goals such as growth, new capability, and patient care. But by shunting scarce resources away from the older technology, this process also stressed the experienced talent (even as it built their resilience) and limited exploration of changes that could benefit the hospital. </jats:p>',\n",

In this article, I draw on theories of stigma by association to explain why firms’ mere proximity to controversial political actors may lead stakeholders to presume that firms silent on social issues are misaligned with the stakeholders’ sociopolitical preferences. Firms, in turn, countervail these presumptions of misalignment by eschewing silence and claiming sociopolitical positions. Substantiating this theory in the context of employee recruitment following the 2017 Unite the Right White supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, I show that Charlottesville’s employers combated presumptions that they shared demonstrators’ anti-diversity positions by making countervailing pro-diversity claims in their online job postings. In supplementary analysis, I show that the rally was associated with a newfound wage premium in job postings by Charlottesville’s employers but that this premium was lower when employers made pro-diversity claims. This study advances understanding of strategic sociopolitical positioning whereby firms make calculated appeals to stakeholders. It contrasts with related research showing that firms use social claims to combat negative evaluations resulting from their own actions or to differentiate from competitors. In doing so, it suggests opportunities for further research investigating, for example, additional motivations for firms’ sociopolitical positioning, how positioning might evolve in the context of growing political polarization, and how positioning might relate to workplace inequality and diversity. </jats:p>',\n",

Our emergent model shows how creators shift ideas across projects by stockpiling ideas from one creative project, transforming them into resources, and mobilizing them in their portfolios. Our analysis reveals that these practices unfold in distinct ways across two different processes for managing ideas: managing ideas strategically to build portfolios by realizing stockpiled ideas in new creative products across different opportunities, and managing ideas symbolically to balance creative outputs with new meanings constructed from unrealized ideas that represent the creator’s identity and journey. Our findings reveal the critical role of stockpiling in creative work, showing how different ways of stockpiling transform ideas into resources for developing a portfolio.

Our study tests and elaborates on stakeholder alignment theory to investigate the influence of CEO activism on employees’ attitudes and behaviors, particularly its effects on employees’ organizational commitment and support for the ideology underpinning the CEO’s public stance. Our theoretical predictions hinge on the degree of alignment between the CEO’s stance and the prevailing ideological tilt of the employee population, as well as the degree to which employees view the CEO as a credible leader. We test our ideas in the context of a highly publicized letter signed by nearly 100 public company CEOs in opposition to North Carolina’s controversial 2016 “bathroom bill.” Relying on multiple data sources to examine differences between firms whose CEOs signed the letter and firms whose CEOs declined the invitation to sign, we find general support for our theory, indicating that CEO activism has important intra- and extra-firm implications. </jats:p>',\n",
       "   '<jats:p> While a positive view of calling has been ubiquitous since its introduction into the literature over two decades ago, research remains unsettled about the extent to which it contributes to various aspects of the good life: an optimal way of living well via worthwhile endeavors. Further, scholars have identified two conceptual types of calling, marked by internal versus external foci; yet their differential impact on outcomes indicative of the good life, such as eudaimonic and hedonic well-being (characterized by the experience of purpose and meaning versus pleasure and happiness, respectively), is unknown. Through a meta-analysis of 201 studies, we provide the first systematic review focused on these two fundamental theoretical issues in the calling literature: how strongly related callings are to outcomes in the domains of work and life and which type of calling (internally or externally focused) more strongly predicts these outcomes, if either. We find that callings more strongly relate to outcomes indicative of the good life than recently argued. We further find that callings are more strongly linked to work than to life outcomes and to eudaimonic than to hedonic outcomes. The two types of calling converge in being associated with many similar outcomes, but they show some divergence: internally focused callings are more positively related to hedonic outcomes and less positively related to eudaimonic outcomes, relative to externally focused callings. This finding supports a view of callings as hierarchically structured, with a higher-order calling factor composed of two correlated yet distinct lower-order calling types. Integrating our meta-analytic findings with relevant literatures, we propose a theoretical model that addresses psychological and social need fulfillment through which different types of callings contribute to the good life. </jats:p>',\n",

We argue that this characterization discounts the unique ways stigmatization can take place within heterogeneous occupations and the challenges it raises for finding support from other occupational members. Based on a six-year qualitative study of the sex work occupation in Canada, we explore the internal dynamics of stigmatization in the occupation. Our analysis reveals that sex workers are not just the stigmatized but also the stigmatizers, as they elaborate, borrow, and adapt perceptions of stigma to rank and place each other into a stigma hierarchy. To avoid the risks of being stigmatized based on this hierarchy, sex workers engage in stealth organizing to find safe others within the occupation to provide social support. Thus the occupation is not a stigma-free safe haven for its workers. Instead, the occupation as a whole is characterized by dissension among its members. Their efforts to find social support lead to what we call bounded entitativity: a sense of being grouplike that is confined to small community groups within a broader occupational context of dissension. We found bounded entitativity to be associated with challenges for occupational members in undertaking social change efforts.</jats:p>',\n",

We argue that in contrast to the prevailing assumption that organizations will strive for favorable ratings to achieve reputational benefits, incompatibility between a positive rating and a dominant institutional logic may cause recognized firms to question the perceived value of maintaining superior performance, thus leading them to strategically reduce their efforts on the rated dimension. Using a difference-in-differences design, we examine how companies responded to being rated as charitable organizations, an evaluation that we argue was generally perceived as incompatible with the dominant logic of shareholder maximization during the early 1990s. Our results suggest that firms that were rated as generous were more likely to decrease philanthropic contributions relative to firms that were not rated as generous. We also found this reaction to be amplified or attenuated by organizational and institutional factors that increased or decreased the saliency of the perceived incompatibility between the philanthropy rating and the dominant shareholder logic. These findings provide insights for scholarship on organizational reactivity and impression management and raise important questions for scholars and practitioners interested in improving the effectiveness of evaluation metrics as drivers of organizational performance.</jats:p>',\n",
       "   '<jats:p> I develop and test a theory that explains why organizations may struggle to adapt in the face of change even when their members are aware of change, are motivated to adapt, and have the resources to do so. I build on complex-systems theory, which posits that organizations face a hierarchy of interdependent problems: they must choose how to fulfill different specialized tasks and choose processes to integrate the outputs of these tasks. Because these choices are interdependent, environmental change that directly affects only a few tasks in isolation can indirectly affect the viability of major organizational processes. Recognizing these ripple effects is difficult, however: understanding complex interdependencies is challenging for decision makers, and the division of labor within organizations can create an illusion of separability between tasks. As a result, organizations may respond to such change by engaging in “modular search” for new ways to fulfill specialized tasks, but they may fail to engage in “systemic search” for new processes integrating the outputs of specialized tasks unless they can rely on information-processing structures that help decision makers better understand interdependencies among choices. I test my theory by applying sequence analysis methods to micro-level behavioral data on competitive video gaming (esports) teams. Qualitative fieldwork and an online experiment provide additional evidence of my proposed mechanisms. </jats:p>',\n",

We investigate whether organizations can use transgression transparency to rehabilitate transgressors. Although making transgressions transparent—which may result in stigmatization or public shaming—is generally assumed to be purely punitive, we show when and how it can foster rehabilitation. We draw on a longitudinal, qualitative dataset of 23 similarly situated transgressors at a military academy that added transparency to traditional punishment by requiring transgressors to wear a pin that signaled their transgression. Data from transgressors and from other organizational members revealed that instead of prompting persistent stigmatization, social awareness of the transgression prompted others’ inquiry, gradually engaging transgressors in a coactive process to develop a mutually acceptable narrative of their transgression through a mechanism we call personal narrative control. For that personal narrative to endure, transgressors needed to exercise self-control and avoid further transgressions, as they did in our study even after the pin was removed, signaling rehabilitation. We induce four contextual conditions for transgression transparency to trigger personal narrative control and theorize how they might generalize to other organizations seeking to rehabilitate transgressors.</jats:p>',\n",

While some scholars argue it is better for workers to specialize and focus on one area, others argue it is advantageous for workers to diversify and compile experience across multiple work domains. We attempt to reconcile these competing perspectives by developing a theory highlighting the voluntary versus involuntary nature of worker–firm separations as a theoretical contingency that alters the relative advantages and disadvantages associated with specialized versus generalized careers. Our theory is rooted in the notion that the characteristics of involuntary worker–firm separations (i.e., job displacement) simultaneously amplify the disadvantages associated with specialized careers and the advantages associated with generalized careers, thereby giving displaced generalists a relative advantage over displaced specialists. We find support for our theory in the context of U.S. congressional staffing, using administrative employment records and a regression discontinuity identification strategy that exploits quasi-random staffer displacement resulting from narrowly decided congressional reelection bids. Our theoretical contingency is further supported in supplemental regressions where correlational evidence suggests that while specialists tend to be relatively penalized in the labor market after involuntary separations, specialists appear to be relatively privileged when separations are plausibly voluntary. </jats:p>',\n",

To develop theory on the role of creativity in driving sustained market success, I propose a path dependence theory of creators’ careers that considers creators’ whole portfolios of products over time and how their early portfolios shape their later capacity to sustain success. The main idea is that a creator’s path to sustained success depends on the creativity in their portfolio at the time of their initial hit—relatively creative portfolios give creators more options for leveraging their past portfolios while adapting to market changes, increasing their odds of additional hits. I tested the proposed theory using an archival study of the U.S. music industry from 1959–2010, including data on over 3 million songs by 69,050 artists, and the results largely support the hypotheses. Artists who reached their initial hits with relatively creative (novel or varied) portfolios were more likely to generate additional hits, but a novel portfolio was less likely to yield an initial hit than was a typical portfolio. These findings suggest that new creators face a tradeoff between their likelihood of initial versus sustained success, such that building a relatively creative early portfolio is a risky bet that can make or break a creator’s career. </jats:p>',\n",

However, a few scholars, as well as anecdotal evidence, suggest that when gazed at from the category level, aesthetic innovation usually occurs as incremental variations of a dominant aesthetic. Extant theory fails to account for why we see cycles of shift and stability in the dominant aesthetic of a category. In this study, we identify the mechanisms that drove such shifts and stability in the dominant aesthetic of the hearing aid category from 1945 to 2015. Leveraging this study, we develop theory showing that alignment or misalignment between category meanings and recent cultural trends spurs producers to generate new categorical aspirations to associate their category with new sets of meanings. However, producers introduce radical new aesthetic innovations only when a change in product form allows them to experiment. Examining aesthetic evolution at the category level helps to shed light on category-level patterns of aesthetic shifts and stability, why attempts to differentiate outside the dominant aesthetic are rare, and why product aesthetics across a category shift synchronously between dominant aesthetics. Furthermore, we enhance understanding of the roles of culture in category evolution and of aesthetics in the construction of category meaning, and we show how such meanings are periodically and collectively renegotiated in mature categories. </jats:p>',\n",

This article explores an accelerator’s impact on startup performance and whether that impact varies substantially by features of the startup’s founding environment. Leveraging data from a leading startup accelerator, I use a regression discontinuity framework to hold startup quality constant so that I can compare the performance of admitted startups to those that do not make the cut, and I examine whether any observed performance differentials are driven by accelerator admission and by characteristics of the startup’s earlier environment. I find evidence that startups from better pre-accelerator environments experience stronger gains from accelerator admission. I also find evidence of home bias, as local startups have a stronger treatment effect. These results provide evidence of ecosystem effects whereby the impact of one organizational sponsor in an ecosystem is strongly moderated by other features in the ecosystem. The findings help to explain the concentration of accelerator programs in already successful entrepreneurial ecosystems and reveal how such programs may interact with founding environments to complement resource abundance or magnify prior resource inequalities. </jats:p>',\n",

Both Chinese and U.S. syndicate lead firms generally prefer including their fellow compatriot firms over comparable non-compatriots in the investment syndicates that they assemble. When a Chinese firm initiates a collaborative first move by including a U.S. firm in an investment syndicate, however, the U.S. firm no longer prefers comparably familiar U.S. firms over the Chinese firm when it subsequently chooses among prospective syndicate partner firms to include in its investment syndicates. In such cases, familiarity triggers impartiality; the experiential trust that was garnered from the collaborative first-move engagement initiated by the Chinese firm diminishes the nationality-based homophilic preferences of the U.S. firm. We do not find similar dynamics when the tables are turned. When a U.S. firm initiates a collaborative first move by including a Chinese firm in an investment syndicate, the Chinese firm subsequently remains partial to fellow compatriot firms that are otherwise comparable to the U.S. firm. The homophilic preferences and identity-based trust between Chinese firms grounded in shared nationality are resilient to any goodwill created by U.S. firms when they initiate collaborative first moves. </jats:p>',\n",

To generate creative ideas, an individual needs to think differently from their group to generate novel ideas that others cannot, while understanding what the group will view as appropriate and practical. We view culture as a network of cultural elements and decompose individuals’ cultural adoption into two conceptually and empirically distinct dimensions. Cultural breadth, which reflects whether individuals have adopted a broad range of values, beliefs, and norms that span the organization’s culture, contributes to the novelty required for creativity. Cultural embeddedness, which reflects whether individuals have adopted the core values, beliefs, and norms entrenched in the organization’s culture, helps an individual generate ideas that others will view as useful. We predict that individuals with both high cultural breadth and high cultural embeddedness, who we label integrated cultural brokers, will be most likely to generate creative ideas that are novel and useful.

Using detailed empirical data, we develop a process model of the dynamics of organizational autonomy in a unit–parent relationship. This process model shows an ongoing dialectical tension between parent managers’ autonomy-reduction efforts and unit managers’ autonomy-extension efforts, and it reveals oscillations in the unit managers’ discretion over resource-orchestration decisions. Driving this dialectic are parent managers’ appraisal respect for the unit, their search for firm-wide strategic integration, and unit managers’ organizational identity and concern for distinctiveness. Our process model captures concurrent feedback loops that endogenously produce these oscillations between lower and higher autonomy. We then conceptualize a harmonic domain in the unit–parent relationship, in which these oscillations persist without deviating toward amalgamation or separation. Finally, we develop a theory of change in autonomy by identifying a theoretical link between resource orchestration and specific dimensions of organizational identity. Our study highlights the dialectical, dynamic, and ongoing nature of organizational autonomy. </jats:p>',\n",

Existing theory suggests that new members of a profession should adapt their identities to align with their profession’s and organization’s goals. Using data from an ethnographic study of first-time hospital nurses, I develop the concept of idealized professional identities—identities rooted in the image and history of an occupation rather than in reality—and depict how these identities can persist through client interactions despite negative consequences. When left unchecked under the increasingly common conditions of weak on-the-job socialization, nurses in my study with idealized identities infantilized patients and purposefully avoided patients who denied their idealized identities even though these practices ran counter to the patient satisfaction and empowerment goals of the organization and nursing profession. The opportunity to enact cherished idealized identities with the few clients who granted them may have perpetuated these dynamics by supporting the retention of professionals who otherwise may have exited. This study suggests that socialization into a professional role may come not only from interactions with professional gatekeepers, peers, or organizational management but also from the internalization of idealized professional identities that may be kept alive through interactions with and about one’s clients. </jats:p>',\n",

I identify an equality policy paradox in which women managers, who openly support gender equality, are more likely than men managers to limit the policy. This apparent contradiction between intentions and actions is reconciled through an interactional role-based mechanism. Specifically, in this setting women managers encounter barriers to developing technical expertise, client relations, and respected authority. They respond by engaging extensively with subordinates, which allows them to effectively manage by brokering information (as an alternative to technical and client-facing tasks) and cultivating cooperation (as an alternative to formal authority). The policy undermines these interdependent activities; reflecting this, women managers generally oppose it. Men managers tend not to experience these constraints, and they focus on technical and client-related tasks that are largely independent of subordinates. The policy maintains these activities; reflecting this, they implement it. By identifying the equality policy paradox and the mechanism underlying it, this study advances theory on managers’ implementation of equality-related practices and policies as well as theory on gender and management. </jats:p>',\n",

When these individuals face external pressure (e.g., via new technology or regulation), they typically turn to peers for guidance in such involuntary reinventions of their work. But it is unclear how some professionals may voluntarily break from deeply ingrained views. Through our study of French anesthesiologists who practice hypnosis, we aim to better understand this little-explored phenomenon. Adopting hypnosis, a technique that many anesthesiologists consider subjective and even magical, contradicted a core tenet of their profession: the need to only use techniques validated by rigorous scientific-based research. Drawing on interviews and observations, we analyze how these anesthesiologists were able to change their views and reinvent their work. We find that turning inward to oneself (focusing on their own direct experiences of clients) and turning outward to clients (relying on relations with clients) played critical roles in anesthesiologists’ ability to shift their views and adopt hypnosis. Through this process, these anesthesiologists embarked on a voluntary internal transformation, or reboot, whereby they profoundly reassessed their work, onboarded people in adjacent professions to accept their own reinvention, and countered isolation from their peers. Overall, we show a pathway to such reinvention that entails turning inward and outward (rather than to peers), a result that diverges significantly from prior understandings of professionals’ transformations. </jats:p>',\n",

While most research has argued that the task standardization and surveillance that accompany algorithmic management will give rise to the quintessential “bad job” (Kalleberg, Reskin, and Hudson, 2000; Kalleberg, 2011), I find that, surprisingly, many workers report liking and finding choice while working under algorithmic management. Drawing on a seven-year qualitative study of the largest sector in the gig economy, the ride-hailing industry, I describe how workers navigate being managed by an algorithm. I begin by showing how algorithms segment the work at multiple sites of human–algorithm interactions and how this configuration of the work process allows for more-frequent and narrow choice. I find that workers use two sets of tactics. In engagement tactics, individuals generally follow the algorithmic nudges and do not try to get around the system; in deviance tactics, individuals manipulate their input into the algorithmic management system. While the behaviors associated with these tactics are practical opposites, they both elicit consent, or active, enthusiastic participation by workers to align their efforts with managerial interests, and both contribute to workers seeing themselves as skillful agents. However, this choice-based consent can mask the more-structurally problematic elements of the work, contributing to the growing popularity of what I call the “good bad” job. </jats:p>',\n",

We show that high-risk prescribing comprises two distinct practices: (1) routinely overprescribing to patients whose prescription -fill patterns are consistent with misuse or abuse, which conforms to the definition of deviance in sociology, and (2) routinely overprescribing to patients whose prescription-fill patterns are within possible bounds of medical use, which does not. We call the second practice “liminal prescribing,” a term that indicates it is legally and morally ambiguous. Using 213.9 million prescriptions to construct a four-year panel of the patient-sharing networks of 500,472 physicians, we find that deviant and liminal prescribers have starkly different social network structures and social influence processes; larger and more cohesive networks among prescribers are associated with more deviance but less liminality. Physicians’ ties to liminal prescribers increase liminal prescribing but do not increase deviance. Our results suggest that liminal prescribing is distinct from deviant prescribing and is not a milder form of deviant prescribing. Liminal prescribing is far more prevalent than deviance and accounts for most of the oversupplied benzodiazepines in our dataset (55.8 versus 8.7 percent, respectively).

Zooming in on storytelling interactions and slowing down to follow their evolution, I find that collective cognitive, political, and emotional elements mediated the narration of logics into effect. While the interactions unfolded within a space of possibilities determined by logics, co-narrators still put much cognitive effort into negotiating which logic was relevant and how it implicated specific ways of understanding and responding to events. Narrators’ subject positions and their perceived interests and emotions also mediated the work of logics on the ground. Decisions were determined by degrees of coherence across these cognitive, political, and emotional elements. When there was high or moderate coherence, the decision followed the resolution implied by the narration. When coherence was low, decision makers rejected the decision implied by the narration. Coherence, then, constrained people’s agency to invoke institutional logic. These results offer compelling new theory about how institutional logics work: logics are neither deterministic nor freely manipulated but instantiated through collective and situated dynamics that set limits on their strategic use. </jats:p>',\n",

For 17 years, I studied a profound societal change, the market turn, inside organizations at their center, investment banks on Wall Street. The banks took a new, market-like form that facilitated the emergence of a cultural–historical new form of personhood, the body entrepreneur. Unlike traditional organizations, which predictably reward employee effort, the banks gradually decoupled rewards from effort, paying bankers for winning first internal and then external competitions and increasingly exposing them to market risk. Bankers internalized this entrepreneurial positioning by transforming their minds and bodies into resources for competitive success regardless of health consequences. As rewards became more elusive, bankers invested more resources, first the mind and then the body, and controlled them in progressively more powerful ways, first through cognitive techniques, then through self-experimentation with drugs. Bankers thus intervened more radically in their minds and bodies than organizations legitimately can, resulting in two qualitative person changes. One, bankers constructed personhood in cultural–historical new ways, changing from the traditional psychological self, which locates processes such as emotions and motivation in the mind, toward a somatic self, the body entrepreneur, which locates them in the body as brain states that bankers could self-design. Two, the body functioned in new ways: not inside–out as a biological imperative but outside–in, fluidly adjusting to changing situations. Whereas prior organizational theories have assumed what the body is, I problematize it, empirically studying the self-technologies through which people construct the culturally situated biologies that compel them to unproblematically reproduce new, market-like organizations.</jats:p>',\n",

We focus on the context of journalism, an occupation undergoing severe destabilization in the U.S. and seen as deeply meaningful by many of its incumbents. Drawing on two waves of interviews with 72 unemployed or former newspaper journalists, conducted over five months, and additional interviews with 22 others, we identified two sets of responses, each characterized by distinctive cognitive, emotional, and behavioral patterns. Building on these findings, we developed the construct of “meaning fixedness” to capture the extent to which individuals view the meaning of the different components of their work to be fixed within one occupational context or flexible across different occupations. We found that participants held different interpretations of journalism’s destabilization and assessments of how portable their work components were to other occupational contexts: flexible-meaning perceivers generally engaged in actions to reinvent their career, while fixed-meaning perceivers engaged in actions to persist in journalism with the hope that their occupation could be restored. Our findings culminate in a model of meaning fixedness and how it shapes individuals’ navigation of occupational destabilization. This research uncovers an individual-level perception that has the potential to shape the varied responses to occupational changes observed in prior research, contributing to the literatures on occupations, the meaning of work, and role transitions. </jats:p>',\n",

While the behavioral theory of the firm has identified performance feedback’s important role in driving organizational risk-taking decisions, it has not considered the intrinsic attributes of alternatives, specifically the magnitude and likelihood of their outcomes, which have been the focus of prospect theory. We argue that these two attributes play a key role in decision makers’ assessment of alternatives, but because achieving organizational goals is the prime objective in organizations, performance feedback drives how decision makers process information regarding these attributes. Analyzing 23,895 fourth-down decisions from the U.S. National Football League, we find that decision makers weigh attainment discrepancy and the magnitude and likelihood of outcomes in their choices, depending on deadline proximity. Furthermore, the size and valence of attainment discrepancy modify the weight of the magnitude and likelihood of outcomes in risky choices.

Leveraging advances in natural-language processing, I analyzed the stereotype content of more than 250,000 Congressional remarks (Study 1) and almost one million tweets (Study 2) by leaders. Women leaders referenced dominance more than men did (using more words like “powerful”), violating stereotypes that depict women as submissive. However, as theory on racialized gender stereotypes suggests, this effect was unique to White leaders. Two additional studies revealed backlash to women leaders’ use of dominant language. Analyzing almost 18,000 editorials revealed the more that women leaders referenced dominance, the more they were portrayed as dominant but also cold. Effects were strongest for Black and Latina women (Study 3). Finally, an experiment using simulated social media profiles found the more that Black women (but not men) leaders referenced dominance, the more voters rated them as less likeable, a result that was unique to Black leaders (Study 4).

My observations of and interviews with medical inpatient teams in a U.S. children’s hospital revealed a small subset of teams that succeeded at working interdependently within a core group (internally) and with a shifting set of peripheral contributors (externally). Brief periods of synchronous internal and external teamwork distinguished these emergently interdependent teams. To achieve these synchronous periods, core team members distributed their focus on internal team members and on peripheral members such as nurses, specialists, patients, and patients’ family members. Furthermore, core teams intertwined synchronous periods with cycles of external and internal coordination as team boundaries expanded and contracted. Such interdependence was associated with more-efficient work: faster morning rounds and, for patients, shorter hospital stays. Additionally, initial meetings among core team members set the stage for more-interdependent work. My findings contribute to dynamic teams research by illuminating the process of how teams can work interdependently as team boundaries expand and contract, to external activities research by suggesting that synchronous periods hold together previously documented cycles of separate internal and external activities, and to team launches research by extending work with more-stable teams to dynamic teams.</jats:p>',\n",

In probing why this might be the case, we find that women movers are more likely to maintain communication ties to colleagues from their previous roles and that these persistent ties give them a discernible and gender-role-congruent explanation for connecting otherwise disconnected units and benefiting from network brokerage. Our results illuminate important mechanisms by which social network dynamics and mobility affect gender inequality and performance in organizations. </jats:p>',\n",
       "   '<jats:p> This article examines whether intermediaries and consumers exert similar influence on producers’ boundary-spanning efforts. I propose that boundary spanning is primarily constrained by intermediaries specialized in the market, not by consumers. Consequently, producers are more likely to obscure boundaries when intermediaries’ power weakens. To test these ideas, I exploit a natural experiment that shifted the hitmaking power of genre-specific radio stations to general consumers and thus partially democratized the market mediation structure of the U.S. commercial music industry. The results indicate that after democratization occurred in 2012, record labels were more likely to introduce crossover offerings that incorporated features from other popular genres. Through mechanism triangulation efforts, I found that strategic reorientation, or producers’ attempt to appeal to a broader spectrum of consumers across genre lines, plausibly explains the crossover effect. This study highlights democratizing changes that dilute intermediaries’ influence as a novel explanation of why constraints on producers’ boundary decisions have weakened in some markets. The findings suggest that intermediaries’ and consumers’ expectations may diverge, acting as conflicting forces that organizations must carefully manage. Many organizations closely monitor intermediaries that are deemed influential, but their influence should not be taken for granted as marketplaces empower consumers and become more democratized. </jats:p>',\n",
       "   '<jats:p> Tedious work is pervasive in creative work, yet it has received little attention in the literature on creativity, including studies of science, innovation, and product development. Drawing from a comparative ethnography of two settings—systems biology and music production—we illuminate tedious work as an essential, previously under-investigated aspect of creative work that becomes increasingly prominent with digitization. Tedious work is repetitive, detail-oriented, and expertise-based, and we classify four types of it: fishing, administrating, polishing, and compiling. We develop a model of how tedious work emerges, why it becomes problematic, and what actors do to reduce its negative effects. Tedious work presents three risks to developing viable, novel outcomes—time drain, disengagement, and information overload—and we identify tactics that actors use to mitigate these risks and support individual creativity and the collective creative process. By unpacking the central notion of iteration and documenting the repercussions of creating novel outcomes with digitization, specifically the potential to amplify tedious work, we provide an important counterpoint to voices that hail digital technology’s low cost and unlimited potential for iteration and refinement. </jats:p>',\n",
       "   '<jats:p> While research has uncovered an array of visible competitive dynamics, a strategic world of competition lies beneath the surface that should also be theorized and empirically traced. We investigate the strategic consequences of “media–rival” common ownership, in which investors own a media company and a non-media focal firm’s rivals. We posit that focal firms receive worse coverage from media outlets when institutional investors hold substantial ownership in both a media company and the focal firm’s rivals because the investors’ common holdings provide them with incentives and power to enhance the competitiveness of their portfolio firms by tainting the focal firm’s media coverage. We account for three moderators to show that this effect amplifies when investors have stronger incentives and power to influence the media and when media executives have incentives to cater to the interests of their investors. Using a novel dataset on common ownership of rival firms and media companies, we find support for our theory. Our study reveals a new invisible hand underlying competitive markets and offers a new view of the media as a strategic tool. </jats:p>',\n",

       "   '<jats:p> Many organizations rely on group work to generate creativity, but existing research lacks theory on how groups’ responses to recognition for creative achievement shape their subsequent creative outcomes. Through an inductive study of bands nominated for a Best New Artist Grammy from 1980 to 1990, we develop a theory of reactions to early recognition in creative groups. Our multi-method analyses include oral histories from members of each band and quantitative data, which we use to triangulate the processes they describe. Our findings reveal that groups developed sets of emergent reactions and active adjustments to the recognition and its consequences, which we call “recognition orientations.” We identify three such orientations—absorbing, insulating, and mixed—that reflect how groups interpret recognition and integrate it into their subsequent processes. Most groups struggled by absorbing recognition, which led to internalizing expectations and opening their relationships to outsiders, ultimately inhibiting creativity. Some groups began to insulate themselves from recognition by externalizing expectations and bounding relationships, allowing them to sustain creative output over time. Finally, other groups developed a mixed orientation, initially experiencing the pitfalls of elevated recognition-seeking but ultimately attempting to insulate their need for external recognition by refocusing on their creative process. These findings reveal that recognition can upend the creative process, and groups that begin absorbing recognition are, ironically, less likely to earn it again in the future. Filling a critical research gap on creative production among groups that intend to continue working together, the results distinguish the skills needed to manage recognition from those needed to generate creativity, and offer insight into how groups enact longevity. </jats:p>',\n",
       "   '<jats:p> Collaboration is critical to organizations and difficult when work is distributed. Prior research has indicated that when individuals are distributed, organizations respond by structuring their work to decrease reciprocal interdependence, reduce the complexity of tasks that individuals perform, or accept moderate inefficiencies. Yet in an increasing number of organizations—location-independent organizations—employees are fully distributed, exist without a physical office, and engage in reciprocally interdependent work. To understand how these distributed organizations collaborate, I undertook an inductive multiple-case study. I identify two patterns of collaboration, an asynchronous orientation and a real-time orientation, and reveal the specific enabling practices for each, with a focus on asynchronous-oriented organizations. This research contributes to the distributed work literature by detailing three novel practices that enable effective collaboration for reciprocally interdependent work without geographic or temporal alignment and to the organizational design literature by identifying distinct approaches to distributed collaboration. This study also engages with the future-of-work conversation by providing empirical grounding that enhances our understanding of the theory, boundary conditions, and nuance of the phenomenon of distributed organizations, specifically location-independent organizations. </jats:p>',\n",
       "   '<jats:p> This multi-method study of managers in a grocery chain identifies a novel mechanism by which threats of gender stereotypes undermine women’s ability to be effective managers. I find that women managers face a task bind, a dilemma that managers experience as they try to disprove a negative group stereotype by doubling down on one set of tasks at the expense of other essential tasks. My analysis of interview, observational, and archival data reveals that, compared to men, women do more tasks in front of subordinates—in this setting, supervisory tasks “on the floor” of the store—in order to showcase their qualifications as managers. In doing so, they forgo attention to other tasks that are less public but no less important to being effective managers—in this setting, planning tasks in the office of the store. Neglecting office tasks ultimately undermines the profitability of women managers’ departments. This study’s identification of the task bind has implications for theory and practice related to stereotype threat and women leaders, showing how the threat of negative gender stereotypes, prompted here by concern about subordinates’ perceptions, can affect managers’ behaviors in ways that detract from the performance of managers themselves and that of their organizations. </jats:p>',\n",

However, the accuracy of person detection is affected by several factors, such as the presence of the person, his trajectory, posture, complex background, and object distortion. In this work, we developed a person-focused dataset that includes various behaviors of students in an educational institution, such as cheating, theft of lab equipment, fights, and threatening situations. This dataset ensures consistent and standardized identification annotations for individuals, making it suitable for detection, tracking, and behavioral analysis of individuals. In addition, we have increased the detection accuracy through an improved architecture called YOLOv5 and introduced an efficient method for detecting global and local anomalous behaviors. This method extracts motion features that accurately describe the person’s movement, speed, and direction. To evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed approach, we validated it against our proposed database and publicly available benchmark datasets. Our method achieves state-of-the-art detection accuracy, namely 96.12%, with an error rate of 6.68% compared to existing methods. The empirical results show a significant improvement in anomalous activity detection. Our paper concludes with a summary and a discussion of possible future research directions.</jats:p>',\n",

Self-cleansing experiments in the literature are mostly performed on circular channel cross-section, while a few studies considered self-cleansing sediment transport in small rectangular channels. Experiments in this study were carried out in a rectangular channel with a length of 12.5\\xa0m, a width of 0.6\\xa0m, a depth of 0.7\\xa0m and having an automatic control system for regulating channel slope, discharge and sediment rate. Behind utilizing collected experimental data in this study, existing data in the literature for rectangular channels are used to develop self-cleansing models applicable for channel design. Through the modeling procedure, this study recommends Lq-norm multiple kernel fusion regression (LMKFR) techniques for self-cleansing sediment transport. The LMKFR is a regression technique based on the regularized kernel regression method which benefits from the combination of multiple information sources to improve the performance using the Lq-norm multiple kernel learning framework. The results obtained by LMKFR are compared to support vector regression benchmark and existing conventional regression self-cleansing sediment transport models in the literature for rectangular channels. The superiority of LMKFR is illustrated in an accurate modeling as compared with its alternatives in terms of various statistical error measurement criteria. The encouraging results of LMKFR can be linked to utilization of several kernels which are fused effectively using an Lq-norm prior that captures the intrinsic sparsity of the problem at hand. Promising performance of LMKFR technique in this study suggests it as an effective technique to be examined in similar environmental, hydrological\\xa0and hydraulic problems.</jats:p>',\n",

Researchers have made many experiments to address the supply and demand imbalance by accurately predicting the energy consumption. This paper presents a comprehensive literature review of forecasting methodologies used by researchers for energy consumption in smart buildings to meet future energy requirements. Different forecasting methods are being explored in both residential and non-residential buildings.

In this study, we address a long-term clinical efficacy evaluation decision-making problem with temporal correlation hybrid attribute characteristics. To address this problem, we propose a novel approach that combines a temporal correlation feature rough set model with machine learning techniques and nonadditive measures. Our proposed approach involves several steps. First, over the framework of granular computing, we construct a temporal correlation hybrid information system, the gradient method is employed to characterize the temporal attributes and the similarity between objects is measured using cosine similarity. Second, based on the similarity of gradient and cosine, we construct a composite binary relation of temporal correlation hybrid information, enabling effective classification of this information. Third, we develop a rough set decision model based on the Choquet integral, which describes temporal correlation decision process. We provide the ranking results of decision schemes with temporal correlation features. To demonstrate the practical applications of our approach, we conduct empirical research using an unlabeled dataset consisting of 3094 patients with chronic renal failure (CRF) and 80,139 EHRs from various clinical encounters. These findings offer valuable support for clinical decision-making. Two main innovations are obtained from this study. First, it establishes general theoretical principles and decision-making methods for temporal correlation and hybrid rough sets.

A further analysis was carried out to determine to what extent existing PPDM/PPDSM methods address the trade-off between data mining accuracy and data privacy which is a significant concern in the area. The systematic literature review was conducted using data extracted from 104 primary studies from 5 reputed databases. The scope of the study was defined using three research questions and adequate inclusion and exclusion criteria. According to the results of our study, we divided existing PPDM methods into four categories: perturbation, non-perturbation, secure multi-party computation, and combinations of PPDM methods. These methods have different strengths and weaknesses concerning the accuracy, privacy, time consumption, and more. Data stream mining must face additional challenges such as high volume, high speed, and computational complexity. The techniques proposed for PPDSM are less in number than the PPDM. We categorized PPDSM techniques into three categories (perturbation, non-perturbation, and other). Most PPDM methods can be applied to classification, followed by clustering and association rule mining.

It is a volatile asset, thus predicting its prices is not easy due to the dependence on multiple external factors. Machine learning models are becoming popular for cryptocurrency price predictions, while also considering social media data. In this article, we analyze the rate of return of three cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin, Ether, Binance) from an investor point of view. We also consider three traditional external variables: S&amp;P 500 stock market index, gold price, and volatility index. The rate of return prediction is based on three stages. First, we analyze the correlation between the cryptocurrency returns and the traditional external variables. Next, we focus on the influential social media variables (from Twitter, Reddit, and Wikipedia). Later, we use these variables to improve prediction accuracy. Third, we test how the standard time series models (such as ARIMA and SARIMA) and four machine learning models (such as RNN, LSTM, GRU and Bi-LSTM) predict one-day rate of return. Finally, we also analyze the risk of investing in each cryptocurrencies using value risk statistics. Overall, our result shows no correlation between cryptocurrency returns and three traditional external variables. Second, we found that overall LSTM model is the best, GRU is the second-best prediction model, while the impact of the social media variables varies depending on the cryptocurrencies. Finally, we also found that investment in gold offers better returns than cryptocurrency during Covid-19-like situations.</jats:p>',\n",

However, as is known to all, the brain works at different levels, and the operation at different levels is interactional and mutually coupled. Unfortunately, until now, we still do not know how the nervous system at different levels is interacting and coupling with each other. This review provides some preliminary discussions on how to address these scientific questions, for which we propose a novel theory of the brain called neural energy. Such a theoretical and research approach can couple neural information with neural energy to address the interactions of the nervous system at various levels. Therefore, this review systematically summarizes the neural energy theories and methods proposed by our research in the field of brain science, as well as the internal relationship between mechanics and neural energy theory. Focuses on how to construct a Wang–Zhang (W–Z) neuron model equivalent to Hodgkin–Huxley (H–H) model by using the idea of analytical dynamics. Then, based on this model, we proposed a large-scale neural model and a theoretical framework of global neural coding of the brain in the field of neuroscience. It includes information processing of multiple sensory and perceptual nervous systems such as visual perception, neural mechanism of coupling between default mode network and functional network of brain, memory switching and brain state switching, brain navigation, prediction of new working mechanism of neurons, and interpretation of experimental phenomena that are difficult to be explained by neuroscience. It is proved that the new W–Z neuron model and neural energy theory have unique functions and advantages in neural modeling, neural information processing and methodology. The idea of large-scale neuroscience research with neural energy as the core will provide a potentially powerful research method for promoting the fusion of experimental neuroscience and theoretical neuroscience in the future, and propose a widely accepted brain theory system between experimental neuroscience and theoretical neuroscience. It is of great scientific significance to abandon the shortcomings of reductive and holism research methods in the field of neuroscience, and effectively integrate their respective advantages in methodology.</jats:p>',\n",

Utilizing the proposed algorithm, a numerical investigation was conducted on 233 mathematical test functions with dimensions of 2–100, and 150,000 function evaluations were performed for optimization purposes. For comparison, a total of ten different classical and new metaheuristic algorithms were utilized as alternative approaches. The statistical measurements include the best, mean, median, and standard deviation of 100 independent optimization runs, while well-known statistical analyses, such as Kolmogorov–Smirnov, Wilcoxon, Mann–Whitney, Kruskal–Wallis, and Post-Hoc analysis, were also conducted. The obtained results prove that the FHO algorithm exhibits better performance than the compared algorithms from literature. In addition, two of the latest Competitions on Evolutionary Computation (CEC), such as CEC 2020 on bound constraint problems and CEC 2020 on real-world optimization problems including the well-known mechanical engineering design problems, were considered for performance evaluation of the FHO algorithm, which further demonstrated the superior capability of the optimizer over other metaheuristic algorithms in literature.

Debates on whether artificial intelligence (AI) can or should be used to solve problems in ethical domains have mainly been driven by what AI can or cannot do in terms of human capacities. In this paper, we tackle the problem from the other end by exploring what kind of moral machines are possible based on what computational systems can or cannot do. To do so, we analyze normative ethics through the lens of computational complexity. First, we introduce computational complexity for the uninitiated reader and discuss how the complexity of ethical problems can be framed within Marr’s three levels of analysis. We then study a range of ethical problems based on consequentialism, deontology, and virtue ethics, with the aim of elucidating the complexity associated with the problems themselves (e.g., due to combinatorics, uncertainty, strategic dynamics), the computational methods employed (e.g., probability, logic, learning), and the available resources (e.g., time, knowledge, learning). The results indicate that most problems the normative frameworks pose lead to tractability issues in every category analyzed. Our investigation also provides several insights about the computational nature of normative ethics, including the differences between rule- and outcome-based moral strategies, and the implementation-variance with regard to moral resources. We then discuss the consequences complexity results have for the prospect of moral machines in virtue of the trade-off between optimality and efficiency. Finally, we elucidate how computational complexity can be used to inform both philosophical and cognitive-psychological research on human morality by advancing the moral tractability thesis.</jats:p>',\n",

However, the majority of the stated indicators for determining the quality of a publication involve factors from the publication that are related to the author or venue of an article but these are not related to the content of the article. The factors related to the quality of publication are ignored by existing literature. The purpose of this research is to identify, categorize, and correlate the quality criteria that influence citations. As a result, a systematic literature review (SLR) is undertaken for factor categorization, and Pearson’s correlation coefficient (PCC) is calculated to quantify the impact of factors on citations. The SLR collects relevant articles from several data sources from 2013 to 2022 and categorizes factors impacting citations. A subset of factors is identified from DBLPV13 dataset and correlation of these factors with citations is studied to observe the impact of these factors on citations. The factors include Readability, Recency, Open Access, Hot topics, Abstract Length, Paper Title Length, and Page Count. Pearson’s correlation is performed to test the impact of aforementioned factors on citations. It can be observed from correlational analysis that Recency, Open Access, Hot topics, Abstract Length, page count have a favorable impact on citations, whereas Readability, Paper title length has a negative relationship with citations. The relationship among the factors is nonlinear therefore Spearman’s Correlation is computed for comparison with existing studies and has been undertaken to validate the empirical and correlational analytic results.

Accordingly, due to their recent promising achievements, a tremendous number of metaheuristic optimizers (MHOs) have been utilized to handle this task. Hence, this effort targets providing a novel thorough review of the most recent MHOs applied to define the ungiven parameters of SOFCs stacks. Specifically, among over 300 attempts, only 175 articles are reported, where thirty up-to-date MHOs from the last five years are comprehensively illustrated. Particularly, the discussed MHOs are classified according to their behavior into; evolutionary-based, physics-based, swarm-based, and nature-based algorithms.

Furthermore, an overall platform is constructed where the reader can easily investigate each algorithm individually in terms of its governing factors, besides, the simulation circumstances related to the studied SOFC test cases.

In order to bring more clarity to research findings, we propose the HIRE (Human, (Artificial) Intelligence, Recruitment, Evaluation) framework with the primary aim of evaluating studies which investigate how Artificial Intelligence can be integrated into the recruitment process with respect to gauging whether AI is an adequate, better, or worse substitute for human recruiters. We illustrate the simplicity of this framework by conducting a systematic literature review on the empirical studies assessing AI in the recruitment process, with 22 final papers included. The review shows that AI is equal to or better than human recruiters when it comes to efficiency and performance. We also find that AI is mostly better than humans in improving diversity. Finally, we demonstrate that there is a perception among candidates and recruiters that AI is worse than humans. Overall, we conclude based on the evidence, that AI is equal to or better to humans when utilised in the hiring process, however, humans hold a belief of their own superiority. Our aim is that future authors adopt the HIRE framework when conducting research in this area to allow for easier comparability, and ideally place the HIRE framework outcome of AI being better, equal, worse, or unclear in the abstract.</jats:p>',\n",

Restructuring international and domestic freight transport chains based on sustainability and green transportation is critical for practitioners and policymakers to reduce pressure on the logistics and transportation industries. This study aims to develop a mathematical model for selecting the most appropriate transportation type, and accordingly, the optimal route in transportation operations to improve the sustainability performance of the freight transportation industry. Therefore, the main goal is to choose the most suitable route and transportation type which contributes to create a more eco-friendly and sustainable transportation system. For this purpose, Neutrosophic Number-based Delphi (NN-Delphi), m-Generalized q-Neutrosophic Sets (mGqNSs)-based Stepwise Weight Assessment Ratio Analysis (MGqNS-SWARA) and mGqNSs-based Additive Ratio Assessment (mGqNS-ARAS) are developed and implemented to set the influential criteria, compute the weights of these criteria, and identify the sustainability performance of the freight mode variants, respectively. According to the final results, \"Cargo security\" and \"Accident rates\" are the most important criteria with a relative importance score of 0.0237, contributing to the sustainability of load transport modes. Moreover, \"Maritime Transport Mode\" is identified as the most sustainable transportation type with a relative importance score of 0.7895. Finally, it is revealed that there is a positive relationship between maritime transport and sustainability. </jats:p>',\n",

In order to ensure the security and integrity for the users, organisations and researchers aim to develop robust filters for spam email detection. Recently, most spam filters based on machine learning algorithms published in academic journals report very high performance, but users are still reporting a rising number of frauds and attacks via spam emails. Two main challenges can be found in this field: (a) it is a very dynamic environment prone to the dataset shift problem and (b) it suffers from the presence of an adversarial figure, i.e. the spammer. Unlike classical spam email reviews, this one is particularly focused on the problems that this constantly changing environment poses. Moreover, we analyse the different spammer strategies used for contaminating the emails, and we review the state-of-the-art techniques to develop filters based on machine learning. Finally, we empirically evaluate and present the consequences of ignoring the matter of dataset shift in this practical field.

However, these models have never been applied to customer credit scoring in peer-to-peer (P2P) lending. Moreover, the imbalanced class distribution in experience replay, which may affect the performance of DRL models, has rarely been considered. Therefore, this article proposes a novel DRL model, namely a deep Q-network based on a balanced stratified prioritized experience replay (DQN-BSPER) model, for customer credit scoring in P2P lending. Firstly, customer credit scoring is formulated as a discrete-time finite-Markov decision process. Subsequently, a balanced stratified prioritized experience replay technology is presented to optimize the loss function of the deep Q-network model. This technology can not only balance the numbers of minority and majority experience samples in the mini-batch by using stratified sampling technology but also select more important experience samples for replay based on the priority principle. To verify the model performance, four evaluation measures are introduced for the empirical analysis of two real-world customer credit scoring datasets in P2P lending. The experimental results show that the DQN-BSPER model can outperform four benchmark DRL models and seven traditional benchmark classification models. In addition, the DQN-BSPER model with a discount factor <jats:italic>γ</jats:italic> of 0.1 has excellent credit scoring performance.</jats:p>',\n",

This problem has many applications such as controlling rumors, sickness spreading, and viral marketing, where its importance has been understood by the research society in the last decade. This paper proposes a new semi-local centrality to identify influential nodes in complex networks based on the theory of Local Average Shortest Path with extended Neighborhood concept (LASPN). LASPN focuses on a distributed technique to extract the subgraph associated with each node and apply the average shortest path theory to it. We use the extended neighborhood concept to find the nearest neighbors of each node with low complexity, where this can lead to high efficiency in dealing with large-scale networks. In addition to applying relative changes in the average shortest path, the proposed metric considers the importance of the node itself as well as its nearest neighbors in ranking the nodes.

Existing research on citation analysis has primarily concentrated on the contents and ignored the complex relations between academic entities. In this paper, we propose a novel research topic, that is, how to detect anomalous citations. To be specific, we first define anomalous citations and propose a unified framework, named ACTION, to detect anomalous citations in a heterogeneous academic network. ACTION is established based on non-negative matrix factorization and network representation learning, which considers not only the relevance of citation contents but also the relationships among academic entities including journals, papers, and authors. To evaluate the performance of ACTION, we construct three anomalous citation datasets. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Due to the increasing spread, confidence in neural network predictions has become more and more important. However, basic neural networks do not deliver certainty estimates or suffer from over- or under-confidence, i.e. are badly calibrated. To overcome this, many researchers have been working on understanding and quantifying uncertainty in a neural network’s prediction. As a result, different types and sources of uncertainty have been identified and various approaches to measure and quantify uncertainty in neural networks have been proposed. This work gives a comprehensive overview of uncertainty estimation in neural networks, reviews recent advances in the field, highlights current challenges, and identifies potential research opportunities. It is intended to give anyone interested in uncertainty estimation in neural networks a broad overview and introduction, without presupposing prior knowledge in this field. For that, a comprehensive introduction to the most crucial sources of uncertainty is given and their separation into reducible model uncertainty and irreducible data uncertainty is presented. The modeling of these uncertainties based on deterministic neural networks, Bayesian neural networks (BNNs), ensemble of neural networks, and test-time data augmentation approaches is introduced and different branches of these fields as well as the latest developments are discussed. For a practical application, we discuss different measures of uncertainty, approaches for calibrating neural networks, and give an overview of existing baselines and available implementations. Different examples from the wide spectrum of challenges in the fields of medical image analysis, robotics, and earth observation give an idea of the needs and challenges regarding uncertainties in the practical applications of neural networks. Additionally, the practical limitations of uncertainty quantification methods in neural networks for mission- and safety-critical real world applications are discussed and an outlook on the next steps towards a broader usage of such methods is given.</jats:p>',\n",

Specifically, it possesses the ability to utilize two or more levels of non-linear feature transformation of the given data via representation learning in order to overcome limitations posed by large datasets. As a multidisciplinary field that is still in its nascent phase, articles that survey DL architectures encompassing the full scope of the field are rather limited. Thus, this paper comprehensively reviews the state-of-art DL modelling techniques and provides insights into their advantages and challenges. It was found that many of the models exhibit a highly domain-specific efficiency and could be trained by two or more methods. However, training DL models can be very time-consuming, expensive, and requires huge samples for better accuracy. Since DL is also susceptible to deception and misclassification and tends to get stuck on local minima, improved optimization of parameters is required to create more robust models. Regardless, DL has already been leading to groundbreaking results in the healthcare, education, security, commercial, industrial, as well as government sectors. Some models, like the convolutional neural network (CNN), generative adversarial networks (GAN), recurrent neural network (RNN), recursive neural networks, and autoencoders, are frequently used, while the potential of other models remains widely unexplored. Pertinently, hybrid conventional DL architectures have the capacity to overcome the challenges experienced by conventional models. Considering that capsule architectures may dominate future DL models, this work aimed to compile information for stakeholders involved in the development and use of DL models in the contemporary world.</jats:p>',\n",

Some deficiencies have existed in the original GOA such as slow convergence speed, and the original GOA may get quickly stuck into local solutions facing some complex. For tackling these drawbacks of the original GOA, enhanced versions of GOA have been proposed to deal with the optimization problems more effectively. In the current study, two strategies have been integrated into GOA: the grouping mechanism of non-linear ‘c’ parameters and the mutation mechanism. Moreover, two different groups of non-linear ‘c’ parameters have been suggested in the grouping mechanism. Incorporating the grouping mechanism into GOA can update the grasshoppers’ positions within a limited local area, whereas the diversity of agents can be improved by integrating the mutation mechanism. Eight Novel-Variants GOA (NVGOAs) are proposed to address the deficiencies of the original GOA. Where two variants NVGOA1_1 and NVGOA2_1 represent the impact of each proposed group of ‘c’ parameters. Another two variants NVGOA3 and NVGOA4 represent the impact of the mutation mechanism with two different values of probability. Moreover, four variants: NVGOA1_2, NVGOA1_3, NVGOA2_2, and NVGOA2_3 represent the combination of the two proposed mechanisms. First, the comparison between the performance of the proposed variants and the original GOA has been conducted. Then, for validation of the efficiency of the proposed NVGOAs, the performance of the best-recorded NVGOA variants has been tested against the 29 CEC-2017 benchmark functions and compared with six state-of-the-art optimization algorithms based on the mean and the standard deviation metrics. Moreover, the Wilcoxon Signed-Rank test has been employed to exhibit the efficiency of the proposed variants. As well comparative analysis with previous enhancements of GOA has been conducted against the best-recorded NVGOA variants. Also, conducting a dimension study between the best-recorded chaotic previous variants against the best-recorded proposed NVGOA variants has revealed the superiority of NVGOAs. The results of all these analyses demonstrated the success and efficiency of the proposed NVGOA variants to solve numerical optimization problems. Concerning demand side management in smart grids, the proposed NVGOA variants have been applied to schedule the loads in three areas: residential, commercial, and industrial to decrease the daily operating costs and peak demand. The results show that the peak demand is reduced by 23.9%, 17.6%, and 9.2% in residential areas, commercial areas, and industrial areas respectively. Also, the operating cost decreased by 7.25%, 9.2%, and 18.89% in residential, commercial, and industrial areas, respectively.

It is a booming area of research gaining attention in the domain of image processing, computer vision and pattern recognition. In this review paper, we present a detailed description of the methods and algorithms of shot boundary detection, reported in the last two decades. This review shows that using multiple features performs well in comparison to using only a single feature in the shot boundary detection problem although it leads to higher complexity. The major sources of disturbance in the boundary detection are the sudden illumination variation and presence of high motion in the video. An adaptive threshold outperforms a single global threshold in the boundary detection problem and the threshold requirement can be avoided through learning based strategies at the cost of larger training data and higher computation time.

No matter how good and efficient an AI model is, users or practitioners find it difficult to trust it if they cannot understand the AI model or its behaviours. Incorporating explainability that is human-centric in event detection systems is significant for building a decision-making process that is more trustworthy and sustainable. Human-centric and semantics-based explainable event detection will achieve trustworthiness, explainability, and reliability, which are currently lacking in AI systems. This paper provides a survey on human-centric explainable AI, explainable event detection, and semantics-based explainable event detection by answering some research questions that bother on the characteristics of human-centric explanations, the state of explainable AI, methods for human-centric explanations, the essence of human-centricity in explainable event detection, research efforts in explainable event solutions, and the benefits of integrating semantics into explainable event detection. The findings from the survey show the current state of human-centric explainability, the potential of integrating semantics into explainable AI, the open problems, and the future directions which can guide researchers in the explainable AI domain.</jats:p>',\n",

In response to this need, several computing paradigms, such as Mobile Edge Computing (MEC), Ultra-dense Edge Computing (UDEC), and Fog Computing (FC), have emerged. These paradigms aim to bring computing resources closer to the end user, reducing delay and wasted backhaul bandwidth. One of the major challenges of these new paradigms is the limitation of edge resources and the dependencies between different service parts. Some solutions, such as microservice architecture, allow different parts of an application to be processed simultaneously. However, due to the ever-increasing number of devices and incoming tasks, the problem of service placement cannot be solved today by relying on rule-based deterministic solutions. In such a dynamic and complex environment, many factors can influence the solution. Optimization and Machine Learning (ML) are two well-known tools that have been used most for service placement. Both methods typically use a cost function. Optimization is usually a way to define the difference between the predicted and actual value, while ML aims to minimize the cost function. In simpler terms, ML aims to minimize the gap between prediction and reality based on historical data. Instead of relying on explicit rules, ML uses prediction based on historical data. Due to the NP-hard nature of the service placement problem, classical optimization methods are not sufficient. Instead, metaheuristic and heuristic methods are widely used. In addition, the ever-changing big data in IoE environments requires the use of specific ML methods. In this systematic review, we present a taxonomy of ML methods for the service placement problem. Our findings show that 96% of applications use a distributed microservice architecture. Also, 51% of the studies are based on on-demand resource estimation methods and 81% are multi-objective.

Consequently, this study focuses on examining the collaborative assembly challenges associated with three crucial parts: the body, electrical cabinet, and pipeline pack, within the industrial robot manufacturing process. Considering the energy consumption during both active and idle periods of the industrial robot workshop assembly system, this paper presents a multi-stage energy-efficient scheduling model to minimize the total energy consumption. Two classes of heuristic algorithms are proposed to address this model. Our contribution is the restructuring of the existing complex mathematical programming model, based on the structural properties of scheduling sub-problems across multiple stages. This reformation not only effectively reduces the variable scale and eliminates redundant constraints, but also enables the Gurobi solver to tackle large-scale problems. Extensive experimental results indicate that compared to traditional workshop experience, the constructed green scheduling model and algorithm can provide more precise guidance for the assembly process in the workshop. Regarding total energy consumption, the assembly plans obtained through our designed model and algorithm exhibit approximately 3% lower energy consumption than conventional workshop experience-based approaches.</jats:p>',\n",

Elevated TDG can cause gas-bubble trauma in fish (GBT). Therefore, controlling TDG fluctuation has become of great importance for different disciplines of surface water environmental engineering.. Nowadays, direct estimation of TDG is expensive and time-consuming. Hence, this work proposes a new modelling framework for predicting TDG based on the integration of machine learning (ML) models and multiresolution signal decomposition. The proposed ML models were trained and validated using hourly data obtained from four stations at the United States Geological Survey. The dataset are composed from: (<jats:italic>i</jats:italic>) water temperature (<jats:italic>T</jats:italic><jats:sub><jats:italic>w</jats:italic></jats:sub>), (<jats:italic>ii</jats:italic>) barometric pressure (<jats:italic>BP</jats:italic>), and (<jats:italic>iii</jats:italic>) discharge (<jats:italic>Q</jats:italic>), which were used as the input variables for TDG prediction. The modelling strategy is conducted based on two different steps. First, six singles ML model namely: (<jats:italic>i</jats:italic>) multilayer perceptron neural network, (<jats:italic>ii</jats:italic>) Gaussian process regression, (<jats:italic>iii</jats:italic>) random forest regression, (<jats:italic>iv</jats:italic>) random vector functional link, (<jats:italic>v</jats:italic>) adaptive boosting, and (<jats:italic>vi</jats:italic>) Bootstrap aggregating (Bagging), were developed for predicting TDG using <jats:italic>T</jats:italic><jats:sub><jats:italic>w</jats:italic></jats:sub>, <jats:italic>BP</jats:italic>, and <jats:italic>Q</jats:italic>, and their performances were compared. Second, a new framework was introduced based on the combination of empirical mode decomposition (EMD), the variational mode decomposition (VMD), and the empirical wavelet transform (EWT) preprocessing signal decomposition algorithms with ML models for building new hybrid ML models. Hence, the <jats:italic>T</jats:italic><jats:sub><jats:italic>w</jats:italic></jats:sub>, <jats:italic>BP</jats:italic>, and <jats:italic>Q</jats:italic> signals were decomposed to extract the intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) by using the EMD and VMD methods and the multiresolution analysis (MRA) components by using the EWT method. Then after, the IMFs and MRA components were selected and regraded as new input variables for the ML models and used as an integral part thereof. The single and hybrid prediction models were compared using several statistical metrics namely, root mean square error, mean absolute error, coefficient of determination (<jats:italic>R</jats:italic><jats:sup><jats:italic>2</jats:italic></jats:sup>), and Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE). The single and hybrid models were trained several times with high number of repetitions, depending on the kind of modeling process. The obtained results using single models gave good agreement between the predicted TDG and the situ measured dataset. Overall, the Bagging model performed better than the other five models with R<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> and NSE values of 0.906 and 0.902, respectively. However, the extracted IMFs and MRA components using the EMD, VMD and the EWT have contributed to an improvement of the hybrid models’ performances, for which the R<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> and NSE were significantly increased reaching the values of 0.996 and 0.995. Experimental results showed the superiority of hybrid models and more importantly the importance of signal decomposition in improving the predictive accuracy of TDG.</jats:p>\\n                <jats:p><jats:bold>Graphical abstract</jats:bold></jats:p>',\n",

Inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) is a specific form of learning from demonstration that attempts to estimate the reward function of a Markov decision process from examples provided by the teacher. The reward function is often considered the most succinct description of a task. In simple applications, the reward function may be known or easily derived from properties of the system and hard coded into the learning process. However, in complex applications, this may not be possible, and it may be easier to learn the reward function by observing the actions of the teacher. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of the literature on IRL. This survey outlines the differences between IRL and two similar methods - apprenticeship learning and inverse optimal control. Further, this survey organizes the IRL literature based on the principal method, describes applications of IRL algorithms, and provides areas of future research.</jats:p>',\n",

The widespread dissemination of disinformation can have destructive effects on people’s attitudes and behavior. So, it is essential to detect disinformation as soon as possible. Therefore, the interest in effective detection techniques has grown rapidly in recent years. Major social media and social networking sites are trying to develop robust strategies to detect disinformation and prevent its spread. Machine learning techniques and especially neural networks, have an essential role in this task. In this paper, we review different approaches for automatic disinformation detection, with a focus on methods that leverage graph neural networks (GNNs). GNNs are very suitable tools for detecting disinformation in social networks. Because on the one hand, graphs are the most comprehensive way to model social networks and on the other hand, GNNs are the best tool for processing graph data. We define different forms of disinformation, and examine the features used and the methods presented from different perspectives. We also discuss relevant research areas, open problems, and future research directions for disinformation detection in social media.</jats:p>',\n",

IVq-RDHFSs, which surpass most existing fuzzy sets, effectively represent complex fuzzy information by describing membership and non-membership degrees through interval value sets. However, prior MAGDM methods based on IVq-RDHFSs have been limited by the functions of operation rules and aggregation operators (AOs). This limitation is addressed through the construction of a new MAGDM framework, leveraging the robust Frank t-norm and t-conorm (FTT) operation and the extended power average (EPA) operator. The proposed framework features the interval-valued q-rung dual hesitant fuzzy Frank weighted extended power average (IVq-RDHFFWEPA) operator to obtain comprehensive evaluation values. The paper also introduces novel techniques for determining the weights of decision-makers and attributes. Practical applications of the proposed method are demonstrated through the assessment of desalination technology selection and rural green eco-tourism projects. Sensitivity and comparison analyses validate the superior functionality, accuracy, and flexibility of this method compared to many state-of-the-art methods. The contributions of this paper are two-fold: it develops efficient measurement techniques for IVq-RDHFSs, such as distance and weight calculation, and it introduces a comprehensive MAGDM method by integrating FTT and EPA under IVq-RDHFSs, which improves the efficiency of solving decision-making problems.</jats:p>',\n",

In this study, ten financial ratios representing five risk areas were considered, namely: Capital Adequacy, Credit, Liquidity, Earning Quality, and Operational risk. Data from 45 Gulf banks for the period 2016–2020 was used to develop the model. Our findings indicate that a bank is in a sound risk position at the 99%, 95%, and 90% confidence level if its Mahalanobis distance exceeds 4.82, 4.28, and 4.0, respectively. The maximum distance computed for the banks in this study was 9.31; only five out of the forty-five banks were below the 4.82 and one below the 4.28 and 4.0 thresholds at 3.96. Sensitivity analysis of the risks indicated that the Net Interest Margin is the most significant factor in explaining variations in a bank’s risk position, followed by Capital Adequacy Ratio, Common Equity Tier1, and Tier1 Equity in order. The remaining financial ratios: Non-Performing Loans, Equity Leverage, Cost Income Ratio, Loans to Total Assets, and Loans to Deposits have the least influence in the order given; the Provisional Loans Ratio appears to have no influence.</jats:p>',\n",

However, this technology presents a critical challenge due to the size of the numerous genes present in the high-dimensional biological datasets associated with an experiment, which leads to a curse of dimensionality on biological data. Such high dimensionality of real biological data sets not only increases memory requirements and training costs, but also reduces the ability of learning algorithms to generalise. Consequently, multiple feature selection (FS) methods have been proposed by researchers to choose the most significant and precise subset of classified genes from gene expression datasets while maintaining high classification accuracy. In this research work, a novel binary method called <jats:italic>i</jats:italic>BABC-CGO based on the island model of the artificial bee colony algorithm, combined with the chaos game optimization algorithm and SVM classifier, is suggested for FS problems using gene expression data. Due to the binary nature of FS problems, two distinct transfer functions are employed for converting the continuous search space into a binary one, thus improving the efficiency of the exploration and exploitation phases. The suggested strategy is tested on a variety of biological datasets with different scales and compared to popular metaheuristic-based, filter-based, and hybrid FS methods. Experimental results supplemented with the statistical measures, box plots, Wilcoxon tests, Friedman tests, and radar plots demonstrate that compared to prior methods, the proposed <jats:italic>i</jats:italic>BABC-CGO exhibit competitive performance in terms of classification accuracy, selection of the most relevant subset of genes, data variability, and convergence rate. The suggested method is also proven to identify unique sets of informative, relevant genes successfully with the highest overall average accuracy in 15 tested biological datasets. Additionally, the biological interpretations of the selected genes by the proposed method are also provided in our research work.</jats:p>',\n",

These concepts offer a more comprehensive means of portraying the relationship between elements and fuzzy concepts, thereby boosting the ability to model complex problems.

The efficiency and accuracy of these techniques have been measured in terms of TPR, FPR, Weighted F-Score, Weighted Precision, Weighted Recall, Accuracy, ROC-AUC curve, and Run-Time. Moreover, comparative results reveal that bagging-based ensemble techniques outperformed boosting-based techniques for text classification.

Nonetheless, a comprehensive overview of ACOSQE and its corresponding solutions is currently lacking. This is the precise gap that our survey seeks to address. To be more precise, we systematically reclassify all subtasks of ABSA, reorganizing existing research from the perspective of the involved sentiment elements, with a primary focus on the latest advancements in the ACOSQE task. Regarding solutions, our survey offers a comprehensive summary of the state-of-the-art utilization of language models within the ACOSQE task.

In the future, the object detection task will be the problem of excessive convergence of semantic segmentation tasks.

That is, we consider whether the experimentation mode is sufficient for market practitioners to consider the work in a real-world use case. Works meeting this requirement are distributed across seven distinct specializations.

However, even though the environmental impact of this behavior is not immediately observed, it leads to increased CO2 emissions coming from energy generation from power plants. It has been shown that about 40% of these emissions come from the electricity consumption and also that about 20% of this percentage could have been saved if we started using energy more efficiently. Confronting such a problem efficiently will affect both the environment and our society. Monitoring energy consumption in real-time, changing energy wastage behavior of occupants and using automations with incorporated energy savings scenarios, are ways to decrease global energy footprint. In this review, we study intelligent systems for energy management in residential, commercial and educational buildings, classifying them in two major categories depending on whether they provide direct or indirect control.

Uncertainty measure (UM) can supply new viewpoints for analyzing data. They can help us in disclosing the substantive characteristics of data. Although there are some UMs to evaluate the uncertainty of hybrid data, they cannot be trivially transplanted into partially hybrid data. The existing studies often replace missing labels with pseudo-labels, but pseudo-labels are not real labels. When encountering high label error rates, work will be difficult to sustain. In view of the above situation, this paper studies four UMs for partially hybrid data and proposed semi-supervised attribute reduction algorithms. A decision information system with partially labeled hybrid data (p-HIS) is first divided into two decision information systems: one is the decision information system with labeled hybrid data (l-HIS) and the other is the decision information system with unlabeled hybrid data (u-HIS). Then, four degrees of importance on a attribute subset in a p-HIS are defined based on indistinguishable relation, distinguishable relation, dependence function, information entropy and information amount. We discuss the difference and contact among these UMs. They are the weighted sum of l-HIS and u-HIS determined by the missing rate and can be considered as UMs of a p-HIS. Next, numerical experiments and statistical tests on 12 datasets verify the effectiveness of these UMs. Moreover, an adaptive semi-supervised attribute reduction algorithm of a p-HIS is proposed based on the selected important degrees, which can automatically adapt to various missing rates. Finally, the results of experiments and statistical tests on 12 datasets show the proposed algorithm is statistically better than some stat-of-the-art algorithms according to classification accuracy.</jats:p>',\n",

This approach ensures a uniform classification quality for individual class classification. Therefore, it prevents outlier classes with terrible results. We focus on the evaluation of critical sensitivity, as a quality criterion. Our proposed classifier eliminates this disadvantage in many cases. Our aim is to present that easily formed hidden classes can significantly contribute to improving the quality of a classifier. Therefore, we decided to propose classifier will have a relatively simple structure. The proposed classifier structure consists of three layers. The first is linear, used for dimensionality reduction. The second layer serves for clustering and forms hidden classes. The third one is the output layer for optimal cluster unioning.

       "   '<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Federated learning (FL) is a machine learning approach that decentralizes data and its processing by allowing clients to train intermediate models on their devices with locally stored data. It aims to preserve privacy as only model updates are shared with a central server rather than raw data. In recent years, many reviews have evaluated FL from the system (general challenges) or server’s perspectives, ignoring the importance of clients’ perspectives. Although FL helps users have control over their data, there are many challenges arising from decentralization, specifically from the perspectives of clients who are the main contributors to FL. Therefore, in response to the gap in the literature, this study intends to explore client-side challenges and available solutions by conducting a systematic literature review on 238 primary studies. Further, we analyze if a solution identified for one type of challenge is also applicable to other challenges and if there are impacts to consider. The conclusion of this survey reveals that servers and platforms have to work with clients to address client-side challenges.</jats:p>',\n",

Furthermore, much research has focused on the inverse relationship between robustness and accuracy, raising problems for real-time and safety-critical systems particularly since they are governed by legal constraints in which software changes must be explainable and every change must be thoroughly tested. While many defenses have been proposed, they are often computationally expensive and tend to reduce model accuracy. We have therefore conducted a large survey of attacks and defenses and present a simple and practical framework for analyzing any machine-learning system from a safety-critical perspective using adversarial noise to find the upper bound of the failure rate. Using this method, we conclude that all tested configurations of the ResNet architecture fail to meet any reasonable definition of ‘safety-critical’ when tested on even small-scale benchmark data. We examine state of the art defenses and attacks against computer vision systems with a focus on safety-critical applications in autonomous driving, industrial control, and healthcare. By testing a combination of attacks and defenses, their efficacy, and their run-time requirements, we provide substantial empirical evidence that modern neural networks consistently fail to meet established safety-critical standards by a wide margin.</jats:p>',\n",

A business shares striking similarity to a living organism, including birth, infancy, rising, prosperity, and falling. The success of a business is not only important to the owners, but is also critical to the regional/domestic economic system, or even the global economy. Recent years have witnessed many new emerging businesses with tremendous success, such as Google, Apple, Facebook etc., yet millions of businesses also fail or fade out within a rather short period of time. Finding patterns/factors connected to the business rise and fall remains a long lasting question puzzling many economists, entrepreneurs, and government officials. Recent advancement in artificial intelligence, especially machine learning, has lend researchers powers to use data to model and predict business success. However, due to data driven nature of all machine learning methods, existing approaches are rather domain-driven and ad-hoc in their design and validations. In this paper, we propose a systematic review of modeling and prediction of business success. We first outline a triangle framework to showcase three parities connected to the business: Investment-Business-Market (IBM). After that, we align features into three main categories, each of which is focused on modeling a business from a particular perspective, such as sales, management, innovation etc., and further summarize different types of machine learning and deep learning methods for business modeling and prediction. The survey provides a comprehensive review of\\xa0computational approaches for business performance modeling and prediction.</jats:p>',\n",

Many service providers envisage anomaly detection criteria to guarantee availability to avoid breakdowns and complexities caused due to large-scale operations. The streaming log data generated is associated with multi-dimensional complexity and thus poses a considerable challenge to detect the anomalies or unusual occurrences in the data. In this research, a hybrid model is proposed that is motivated by deep belief criteria and meta-heuristics. Using Search-and-Rescue—BrainStorm Optimization (SAR-BSO), a hybrid feature selection (FS) and deep belief network classifier is used to localize and detect anomalies for streaming data logs. The significant contribution of the research lies in FS, which is carried out using SAR-BSO which increases the detection power of the model as it selects the most significant variables by minimizing redundant features. The evaluation of accuracy is efficiently improved when compared with the predictable methods, such as Extract Local Outlier Factor (ELOF), Track-plus, Hybrid Distributed Batch Stream (HDBS), IForestASD, DBN, BSO-based Feature Selection with DBN, Genetic Algorithm-Deep Belief Network (GA-DBN), Mutual Information-Deep Belief Network (MI-DBN), information entropy-Deep Belief Network(I\\u2009+\\u2009DBN), Flat Field-Deep Belief Network (FF\\u2009+\\u2009DBN), African Vulture Optimization Algorithm-Deep Belief Network(AVOA\\u2009+\\u2009DBN), Gorilla Troop Optimizer-Deep Belief Network(GTO-DBN), and SARO-based Feature Selection with DBN. Further, the accurate detection of the anomalies in the data stream is established by the Deep Belief Neural Network (DBN) classifier. The model’s efficacy is determined using Apache, Hadoop, HDFS, Spark, and Linux datasets and evaluated against existing similar models. The model efficiency is provided using multiple evaluation metrics and is found effective. From the experimentation, the accuracy of the proposed model is found to be 93.3, 95.4, 93.6, 94.2, and 93.5% respectively for the dataset such as Apache, Hadoop, HDFS, spark, and Linux. This enhancement in accuracy is due to the selection of optimal features by the proposed SAR-BSO algorithm.</jats:p>',\n",

Early detection and diagnosis can effectively help facilitate subsequent clinical treatment and management. With the growing advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning (DL) techniques, an increasing number of computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) methods based on deep learning have been applied in cervical cytology screening. In this paper, we survey more than 80 publications since 2016 to provide a systematic and comprehensive review of DL-based cervical cytology screening. First, we provide a concise summary of the medical and biological knowledge pertaining to cervical cytology, since we hold a firm belief that a comprehensive biomedical understanding can significantly contribute to the development of CAD systems. Then, we collect a wide range of public cervical cytology datasets. Besides, image analysis approaches and applications including cervical cell identification, abnormal cell or area detection, cell region segmentation and cervical whole slide image diagnosis are summarized. Finally, we discuss the present obstacles and promising directions for future research in automated cervical cytology screening.</jats:p>',\n",

It is a data-driven technique that optimises a predictive model via learning from a large dataset. Digitisation in industry has included acquisition and storage of a variety of large datasets for interpretation and decision making. This has led to the adoption of deep learning in different industries, such as transportation, manufacturing, medicine and agriculture. However, in the mining industry, the adoption and development of new technologies, including deep learning methods, has not progressed at the same rate as in other industries. Nevertheless, in the past 5 years, applications of deep learning have been increasing in the mining research space. Deep learning has been implemented to solve a variety of problems related to mine exploration, ore and metal extraction and reclamation processes. The increased automation adoption in mining provides an avenue for wider application of deep learning as an element within a mine automation framework. This\\xa0work provides a compact, comprehensive review of deep learning implementations in mining-related applications. The trends of these implementations in terms of years, venues, deep learning network types, tasks and general implementation, categorised by the value chain operations of exploration, extraction and reclamation are outlined. The review enables shortcomings regarding progress within the research context to be highlighted such as the proprietary nature of data, small datasets (tens to thousands of data points) limited to single operations with unique geology, mine design and equipment, lack of large scale publicly available mining related datasets and limited sensor types leading to the majority of applications being image-based analysis. Gaps identified for future research and application includes the usage of a wider range of sensor data, improved understanding of the outputs by mining practitioners, adversarial testing of the deep learning models, development of public datasets covering the extensive range of conditions experienced in mines.</jats:p>',\n",

Medical image captioning is involved in various applications related to diagnosis, treatment, report generation and computer-aided diagnosis to facilitate the decision making and clinical workflows. Unlike generic image captioning, medical image captioning highlights the relationships between image objects and clinical findings, which makes it a very challenging task. Although few review papers have already been published in this field, their coverage is still quite limited and only particular problems are addressed. This motivates the current paper where a rapid review protocol was adopted to review the latest achievements in automatic medical image captioning from the medical domain perspective. We aim through this review to provide the reader with an up-to-date literature in this field by summarizing the key findings and approaches in this field, including the related datasets, applications and limitations as well as highlighting the main competitions, challenges and future directions.</jats:p>',\n",
